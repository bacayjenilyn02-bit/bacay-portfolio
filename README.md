Building my portfolio was both an educational and challenging process that helped me strengthen my technical and design abilities. 
One of the difficulties I faced was keeping the layout neat and well-structured. In the beginning, the site appeared unorganized,
with inconsistent spacing and typography that made the content hard to read. To fix this, I implemented a grid layout, refined font choices, and ensured proper alignment.
These changes created a clearer visual hierarchy, improving readability and overall presentation.‎Another significant challenge was making the portfolio responsive across different devices.
At first, certain elements did not adjust properly on mobile screens, resulting in a poor viewing experience.
To resolve this, I applied CSS flexbox and media queries, which allowed the design to adapt smoothly to desktops, tablets, and smartphones. 
Accessibility was another priority; I added descriptive alt text for images and improved color contrast to ensure the site was usable for more people.
‎I also learned how valuable it is to reduce unnecessary complexity. By simplifying navigation, using short and direct text, and including visible calls-to-action, 
I was able to make the site more user-friendly.‎In the future, I plan to enhance the portfolio further by adding interactive features such as animations or hover effects to make it more engaging.
I also want to include additional project entries, a downloadable resume, and possibly a blog to showcase ongoing work and learning.
Overall, this project emphasized the importance of combining design, usability, and accessibility to create a polished professional portfolio.
